# 100 days of EVM

This is a challenge inspired by the popular `100DaysOfCode` trend, which is a challenge to build the habit of writing and studying software by doing it daily. _I want to do the same, but with the Ethereum Virtual Machine._

---

## Rules (very simple)

- Spend 1 hour every day implementing or studying the EVM
- The 100 days don't have to be strictly consecutive. It's on a best-effort basis.
- Document the progress daily

## Roadmap

- First goal: Implement a minimal EVM in Typescript that must pass all tests of the [evm-from-scratch](https://github.com/w1nt3r-eth/evm-from-scratch) challenge.

## Progress

- [x] [Day 0](./day00.md): Research of relevant learning material & tools to get started
- [x] [Day 1](./day01.md): Gathering more resources & reading Mastering Ethereum chapter 13
- [x] [Day 2](./day02.md): Setting up the EVM-from-scratch challenge & EVM class
- [x] [Day 3](./day03.md): Reading the yellow paper & EVM inception (EVM inside EVM)
- [x] [Day 4](./day04.md): Stack & memory implementation & first OPCODEs
- [x] [Day 5](./day05.md): PUSH, POP, SUB opcodes, MachineState context struct
- [x] [Day 6](./day06.md): Most Arithmetic, Comparison, Bitwise operations & JUMP opcodes
- [x] [Day 7](./day07.md): Memory structure & related OPCODEs
- [x] [Day 8](./day08.md): TxData, globalState, Block data & related OPCODEs
- [x] [Day 9](./day09.md): More Environmental Opcodes & CALLDATALOAD. "Officially" started the challenge!
