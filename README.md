# 100 days of EVM

This is a challenge inspired by the popular `100DaysOfCode` trend, which is a challenge to build the habit of writing and studying software by doing it daily. _I want to do the same, but with the Ethereum Virtual Machine._

---

## Rules (very simple)

- Spend 1 hour every day implementing or studying the EVM
- The 100 days don't have to be strictly consecutive. It's on a best-effort basis.
- Document the progress daily

## Roadmap

- First goal: Implement a minimal EVM in Typescript that must pass all tests of the [evm-from-scratch](https://github.com/w1nt3r-eth/evm-from-scratch) challenge.

## Progress

- [x] [Day 0](./daily-progress/day00.md): Research of relevant learning material & tools to get started
- [x] [Day 1](./daily-progress/day01.md): Gathering more resources & reading Mastering Ethereum chapter 13
- [x] [Day 2](./daily-progress/day02.md): Setting up the EVM-from-scratch challenge & EVM class
- [x] [Day 3](./daily-progress/day03.md): Reading the yellow paper & EVM inception (EVM inside EVM)
- [x] [Day 4](./daily-progress/day04.md): Stack & memory implementation & first Opcodes
- [x] [Day 5](./daily-progress/day05.md): PUSH, POP, SUB Opcodes, MachineState context struct
- [x] [Day 6](./daily-progress/day06.md): Most Arithmetic, Comparison, Bitwise operations & JUMP Opcodes
- [x] [Day 7](./daily-progress/day07.md): Memory structure & related Opcodes
- [x] [Day 8](./daily-progress/day08.md): TxData, globalState, Block data & related Opcodes
- [x] [Day 9](./daily-progress/day09.md): More Environmental Opcodes & CALLDATALOAD. "Officially" started the challenge!
- [x] [Day 10](./daily-progress/day10.md): CALLDATASIZE, CALLDATACOPY, CODESIZE, CODECOPY Opcodes
- [x] [Day 11](./daily-progress/day11.md): EXTCODESIZE, EXTCODECOPY, SELFBALANCE Opcodes
- [x] [Day 12](./daily-progress/day12.md): Research & study on the Storage / data layer of the Ethereum protocol
- [x] [Day 13](./daily-progress/day13.md): Simple Storage implementation, SSTORE, SLOAD, RETURN, REVERT Opcodes
