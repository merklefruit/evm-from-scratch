# 100 days of EVM

This is a challenge inspired by the popular `100DaysOfCode` trend, which is a challenge to build the habit of writing and studying software by doing it daily. _I want to do the same, but with the Ethereum Virtual Machine._

---

## Rules (very simple)

- Spend 1 hour every day implementing or studying the EVM (and document the process)
- The 100 days don't have to be strictly consecutive. It's on a best-effort basis.
- Make a public commitment to the challenge (e.g. tweet, blog post, etc.)
- Share my progress every day (e.g. tweet, blog post, etc.)

## Progress

- [x] [Day 0](./day00.md): Research of relevant learning material & tools to get started
- [x] [Day 1](./day01.md): Gathering more resources & reading Mastering Ethereum chapter 13
- [x] [Day 2](./day02.md): Setting up the EVM-from-scratch challenge & EVM class
- [x] [Day 3](./day03.md): Reading the yellow paper & EVM inception (EVM inside EVM)
- [x] [Day 4](./day04.md): Stack & memory implementation & first OPCODEs
